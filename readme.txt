#Capstone Project 15- Online Shopping Cart
##Project Information
This is an online furniture shop, with a catalogue page and cart page. The cart page containers an option to select delivery or collection and to see the total including tax. I need to fix the voucher and total system. 
##Motivation
This was one of the capstone projects on my bootcamp for HyperionDev. I would like to continue to work on it when my bootcamp has completed so I may perfect some of the areas that are not working together. 
##Code style
Vanilla Javascript and Jquery
##Installation
This project uses HTML, CSS, Javascript and some Jquery features. To use this project you would need to download and install visual studio and you will also need to get the latest links for the CDN for bootstrap and Jquery 

##How to use?
Use the site with the options to add to cart button, input delivery options and information, when clicked on buying items you will get a random reference number. Most buttons and functions are working. 

If people like your project theyâ€™ll want to learn how they can use it. To do so include step by step guide to use your project.
##Contribute
The cart page needs to be updated to take an input from a user to apply a discount code. On the catalogue page, the pop up with totals only appear after a second click. The cart page totals with discount would need to be remedied. 
##Credits
I really appreciated the steps from https://makeschool.org/ to help me make this cart work, their tutorials assisted in helping me complete my task.
